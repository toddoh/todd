## Where to focus ...as an engineer

Knowing where exactly to focus on is important. It's an anchor, a direction that shapes up (or determines) the next step. This will be a series of articles about that, covering each area, or "perspective", I'm associated with on a day-to-day basis.

### Being a "great" engineer is tough

I don't really recall when this ridiculous level of engineer/coding boom started, but roughly in the past 10 years. Thanks to many great materials available online, learning the basic skills of engineering, notably coding, has become more "accessible". However, if you ask me about whether that makes you become a great engineer, by simply learning "stuff", I highly doubt it.

Like every profession, you need to define how "great" you want to be in that domain. This applies to engineer, if not significant. This is an open question and there should not be a definite answer that applies globally. But I'd argue that working at a well-known firm should not be a criteria.

The way I define "greatness" of an engineer is fairly straightforward; genuine interest in technology, tirelessly learn and build a solid foundation, and a devotion to/pride in what you build and write.

### Genuine interest is the starting point.

Yes, having a genuine interest in technology/engineering is _the_ starting point. But that's not the finishing line either. Backed by such motivation, you need to continuously learn and refine the foundation. I'm not talking about frameworks and tools â€” it's about fundamentals. Let's say, on front-end web technology, React can be one of your skillsets, but without understandings on basics, you could end up having/following a wrong pattern. JavaScript on a language level, HTML and DOM rendering on the specs and browser level, it all shoul be in the package.

Understanding, or trying to understand what's beneath the stack you're on is important. At the same time, on a high-level what pattern/design are you adopting should be in your mind. Without both of these, you could end up creating a piece that just doesn't work.

What's most important, per my experience, is to create a cycle of enjoying those technical explorations and conversations. Unless you truly enjoy, you'll never really do it.

### It never ends

Those areas of focus may sound as if it's for when you're bootstrapping engineer career, but it should continue until you get "discharged" from hands-on engineering work. Or maybe even after moving onto managerial track, you should continue doing so.

That's the nature of engineering. Nothing stays same. Wait, that's the nature of life and society. Everything and anything can change over time.
