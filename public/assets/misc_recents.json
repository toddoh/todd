        "Session Abstract: In this talk, you will hear the recent architecture migration of Alloy's front-end to be a dedicated service, how we executed with minimal disruption, and why that was possible. Often the perception of a front-end architecture is about what's visible on the app surface, but it can expand beyond onto infrastructure when building mission-critical front-end. Also, it involves a delicate architecture design and approach, and not seeing through those aspects early on could lead to a less cohesive strategy for migrating onto a resilient and modern front-end. Learn about how Alloy planned, researched, and executing migration with the mindset of incremental change and holistic thinking on our stack, and what could have worked better."
